EXTENSION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

In order for Vanilla to recognize an extension, it must be contained within it's own directory within the extensions directory. So, once you have downloaded and unzipped the extension files, you can then place the folder containing the default.php and calendar.css files into your installation of Vanilla. The path to your extension's default.php file should look like this:

/path/to/vanilla/extensions/Calendar/default.php

Once this is complete, you can enable the extension through the "Manage
Extensions" form on the settings tab in Vanilla.

====================================

====================================
EXTENSION CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

You must first go into the default.php file and cut & paste the language definitions into your conf/language.php file.

Then you can go back into the default.php file and change the link and header names to what you want them to be and also change the links to the correct php pages you want them to link to.
